# rustables-sys

Low level FFI bindings to [`libnftnl`], a userspace library providing a
low-level netlink programming interface (API) to the in-kernel nf_tables
subsystem.

See [`rustables`] for a higher level safe abstraction.

## Linking to libmnl and libnftnl

By default this crate uses pkg-config to find and link to its C dependencies,
[`libmnl`] and [`libnftnl`]. To manually configure where to look for these
libraries, set the environment variables `LIBMNL_LIB_DIR` and
`LIBNFTNL_LIB_DIR` to point to the directories where `libmnl.so` (or
`libmnl.a`) and `libnftnl.so` (or `libnftnl.a`) reside.

## Selecting version of `libnftnl`

This crate has bindings for most versions of [`libnftnl`]. All bindings are
generated by [`bindgen`] via the `generate_bindings.sh` script in this
repository.

Only one version of `libnftnl` can be exposed via this crate. By default the
crate exports the bindings for the oldest supported version (`libnftnl-1.0.6`).
To get newer versions activate the corresponding features. See `Cargo.toml` for
available features/versions.

So for example, to get bindings to `libnftnl-1.0.9` depend on this crate like
this:
```toml
[dependencies]
rustables-sys = { version = "0.1", features = ["nftnl-1-0-9"] }
```
